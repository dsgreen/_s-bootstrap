under-boot
==========

This is a blank starter theme based on the `underscores` theme (http://underscores.me). It adds a few Bootstrap classes to the theme markup but is designed to be a starter theme for a custom design rather than a complete theme. Customize as you see fit.

Some things have been added to the default `underscores` theme, including:

* The `container-fluid` class to the main content container
* IE conditional classes and the `no-js` class to the HTML tag
* The main navigation menu uses the Bootstrap navbar component format
* Example code for custom post thumbnail sizes
* Loads Bootstrap and jQuery assets via their respective CDNs
* Includes a customized version of the Modernizr library
* Includes a `main.js` file with SVG to PNG code example, and adds `img-responsive` class to images within posts
* `underscores` CSS overridden by Bootstrap is commented out
* A `_custom.scss` file with Bootstrap overrides
